# Code repository for NYU MA-UA 252 007: Numerical Analysis

Here you can download all the demo codes I have written for the course, in or out of class.

Please email jkaye@cims.nyu.edu with questions or issues.

Here is a list of the example scripts:

- matlab_demo.m: basic demo of MATLAB functionality
- projectile.m: root-finding for initial angle of projectile motion
- poly_roots_fpi.m: find root of cubic equation using fixed point iteration

Here is a list of functions:

- bisection.m: bisection method for given number of iterations
- newton.m: Newton's method for given number of iterations
- secant.m: Secant method for given number of iterations
